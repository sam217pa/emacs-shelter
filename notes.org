* TODO support tabulating
When many are provided, support tabulating them as in:

#+begin_example
a - function | b - function
c - function | d - function
#+end_example
* TODO overlay should overrides faces

For example in org mode, the title faces are echoed in the overlay.
Maybe should find a way to reset faces to their default before
propertizing the menu.
