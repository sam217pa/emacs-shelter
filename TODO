* TODO fix providing
As of now I donâ€™t think that the current
export method is optimal. One should be
able to use shelter without having to use
shelter-r, since shelter-r has many more
dependencies that are not that necessary
to the rest of shelter per se.
* TODO fix loading
I think that maybe with-eval-after-load
should be added somewhere, rather than
silencing the byte-compiler using ad-hoc
methods.
